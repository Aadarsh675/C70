        <p>St. Xavier offers a wide range of opportunities both within and beyond the curriculum.  We offer extra-curricular opportunities with a vision to grow the range of experiences for students, encouraging them to become intellectually competent, committed to doing justice, more loving, and more religious.  Some clubs are meant to be just for fun and offer a great way to grow socially and make new friends, while others can be a great way to develop and expand leadership skills.

        There is a club fair each year in the Ellis Gym right after the start of the school year where students can learn more about clubs that may interest them.  You can also email the club moderator at any time to find out more information about a club.  Announcements are made during the week letting students know when clubs are meeting and any new or changing clubs.

        If a student is interested in starting a new club or if they have any other questions, they can see Mr. Tim Banker in room 1500 during the school day.</p>

        <p>No one knows how much money Dr. Lyle Tullis gave away to students. I was his colleague for nearly a decade and I never ceased to be amazed at his generosity. He taught sociology; I taught missions.

        Our university has an aggressive program of providing cross-cultural experiences for students. Lots of students take advantage of summer experiences overseas. Early on, I discovered that no group left for overseas without some of its members receiving substantial financial help from Dr. Tullis.

        It wasn't that he made a lot of money. For one thing, he taught at a church-run institution. As a result, his salary was half of what his counterparts earned in nearby tax-supported institutions.

        Other faculty members occasionally groused about comparatively low pay scale. Not Lyle Tullis. Occasionally a professor would leave our campus for a more lucrative position. A couple of them told me they did so because, with higher pay checks, "I can better provide for my family."

        The size of Lyle Tullis' paycheck never seemed to be the most important thing to him. I realized that one day when I was thanking him for helping a student with mission trip costs.

        His eyes twinkled as he said to me, "Aw, I've got so much money I don't know what to do with it. So, I just give it away."

        Most folks wouldn't have thought that way. Dr. Tullis drove one of the older cars on campus. It was certainly older than almost any of the students' cars. His home, while comfortable, was not the fanciest of faculty homes. But Lyle Tullis lived grandly with the feeling that he had so much money he needed to give it away.

        He was one of the favorites on campus. A cynic might say that he bought that approval. But they would misunderstand. Lyle wanted to invest his life, all of it, in people. He'll never leave a large estate; but he will leave a legacy.</p>

Real time account balances take the guess work out of whether a child has lunch money in their account. Easily customized for free, reduced or full pay lunch. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Many school districts have existing school lunch systems. It would be difficult to persuade individual districts to change carriers without a compelling reason. Focusing solely on small districts, up to 2500 students, limits the effectiveness. Accomodating smaller private schools, or larger districts would be helpful.</p>
